# Hello-World
First code in ages!
I started coding in 2008. I wasn't good at it... and it took me quite some time to be proficient. I wonder if I did not have the skill or the temprament. Or if I could have done well with some guided mentorship. But why would have anyone taught me the basics? I did not know the basics. That was the biggest issue
Anyway, I got better at it but that was not the life I wanted to lead. So I stopped working in software in 2011
The next time I wrote code was at grad school when I was learning statistics using SAS. It was a struggle again till I put some effort at it and understood what little there was for me to learn. I ended up teaching SAS for the next two semesters
Then I picked up STATA for a project. It was easy. And now I am here, back to writing code.
The difference? I am exicted this time :)
